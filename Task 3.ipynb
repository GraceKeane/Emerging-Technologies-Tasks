    "The standard deviation of an array of numbers $x$ is calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)).\n",
    "However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDDEV.P and STDDEV.S . The STDDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x). Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence. \n",

    "In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.[1] A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. [5] It is represented as STDDEV in excel."
