    "However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S. The STDEV.P function performs the above calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather than len(x). Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence. \n",

    "In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.[1] A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. [5] Standard deviation is represented as STDEV in excel and is calculated using the $n$ method. "
