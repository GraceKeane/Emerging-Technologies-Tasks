    "A Contingency table (also called crosstab) is used in statistics to summarise the relationship between several categorical variables. For this task I am given data from a city of $1,000,000$ residents with four neighborhoods: $A, B, C,$ and $D$. A random sample of $650$ residents of the city is taken and their occupation is recorded as \"white collar\", \"blue collar\", or \"no collar\". The null hypothesis is that each person's neighborhood of residence is independent of the person's occupational classification. The data is recorded in the contingency table above. Essentially the aim of this task is to conclude whether the two variables (neighborhood and occupation) are related to each other."

I used a p-value to verify this hypothesis. I defined a significance factor to determine whether the relation between the variables is of significance. Generally an alpha value of $0.05$ is chosen. This alpha value denotes the probability of erroneously rejecting $H0$ when it is true. A lower alpha value is chosen in cases where we expect more precision. If the p-value for the test comes out to be strictly greater than the alpha value, then $H0$ holds true and if not the $H0$ value is false."
